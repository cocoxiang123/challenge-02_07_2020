You have a total of n coins that you want to form in a staircase shape, where every k-th row must have exactly k coins.

Given n, find the total number of full staircase rows that can be formed.

n is a non-negative integer and fits within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.

Example 1:

n = 5

The coins can form the following rows:
¤
¤ ¤
¤ ¤

Because the 3rd row is incomplete, we return 2.
Example 2:

n = 8

The coins can form the following rows:
¤
¤ ¤
¤ ¤ ¤
¤ ¤

Because the 4th row is incomplete, we return 3.

solution:

/**
 * @param {number} n
 * @return {number}
 */
var arrangeCoins = function(n) {
    let left = 1;
    let right = n;
    
    while(left<=right){
        let mid = Math.floor(left +(right - left)/2);
        if(mid*(mid+1)/2<=n){
            left = mid + 1;
        }
        else{
            right =mid -1;
        }
       
    }
     return left-1;
    
    
};
